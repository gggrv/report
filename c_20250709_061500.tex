\t{Proper dream}: me walking somewhere on summer day, relizing there is a cobweb-like thing on my hair, trying to figure something out, but being stopped by continuous worried \qappr{You'll regret} with a heavy Greek \comm{?} accent. Thank you very much, jolted back to here \imi{today} safely. No more dreams like that please. No \t{proper dreams} at all please until everything is ready. For now just taking medicines and relaxing with family/friends.

Please don't play phone notifications/voices into my head. Simple button clicking = turn on the phone and check the time, understood.

Left hand sometimes hurts, as if it had unfinished puppet joints in the wrist, will be careful with it today.

Laundry day today.
