Instead of wasting your time and cognitive effort on war-like \qdesc{trolling} \imi{breaking things in order to prove your superiority? you already are superior, nobody was ever arguing about that}, please help me restore the \t{n2/ptoolset_framework/git/branch/clear} that you made me delete in the first place. Thank you in advance. It is needed for solving the Chicago trading system.

The language, used in Chicago trading system actors analysis, is not war-like trolling \emdash\ it is genuinely the only way my mind can understand what is happening there. Comparison with garbage and microbes \emdash\ this is the minimum polite analogy that my human brain can understand in this unique scenario. Analogies are always written in text for clarity, and are never acted out out loud for any effect.

And the book that I am currently reading \emdash\ \t{James Garbarino Children and the Dark Side of Human Experience} \emdash\ is genuinely curious, about life in different cultures, just check the content index instead of making some assumptions based on dramatic title. Legit polite humane book. Not applicable to me in any way. Legit interesting book about the world. When a person looks at a globus/atlas, you assume they perceive themselves to be unhappy? Can I read a good book on Saturday please?
