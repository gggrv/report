After talking about the game \t{PREY}, the cat caught and ate the mouse. Grotesque, life.

After talking about \t{DO NOT THE \%s}, the cat sat on my bed and stopped using claws when playing. Bed \emdash\ no \imi{germs}, paws without injuries \emdash\ cute, cute, cute!

\hatw\ No more writing after the pills.
