It's just an MRI scan. I'm so stupid. As if Outrider Amber needs to find cat and feed it with the dog at the same place. Traveler, paimon, sharing food. Cat, dog, human eating at the same table diverse food peacefully. Those who know it become the next Genshin character. That's what came to my mind. I wanna hear your music! It is heavenly! Let's harmonize in sync! I'm all yours \imi{in a gentle, safe, sane, consensual sense}. A little bit of arousal is ok! Hugging, holding hands, attraction \imi{indescribably subtle tingling appeal} / attraction \imi{cute childish choo-choo train ride across the wonderland} is ok! I \f{\t{love}} \& \t{\f{love}} you! Me! Everyone! Just let's have a faily tale-like magical party together! With a bit of pumpkin anna witch and a breathing space with magic tingling powder sparkling spice and everything nice \emdash\ fresh air!

I'll continue/evolve this idea during tonight beautiful therapy session. Already excited for it! Now a bit calmer. Breathe in 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, wait 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 out 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, wait ,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Every seventh beat. Na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
