Life/growth is analog \imi{slow, with integrity}. Death is binary, from inside out \imi{deepest core off, detach head, do whatever}. \\
This way life beautifully mercifully dies. Dead things then are reworked into life via something akin to spider threads. \\
Correct? That's the eternal self-sustaining \imi{heating/cooling, powering, powdering??? what? something to do with useful beautiful dust} system.

Like a slowly growing eternal tree that cuts its own branches and plays both analog/digital music, \overstrike{perfectly isolated in a ball} \fix{snowglobe? hourglass? ????? untouchable \imi{limitlessly cannot reach it when trying to, therefore 100\% self-balancing} pure-white-light slime that dances to the musics}?
