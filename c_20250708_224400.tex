Not sure if this is a lucid dream or not. \qdesc{A moment before} I wanted to get to sleep so bad, unbelievably sleepy. Then I took the prescribed medicine and \f{hit the hay} \comm{as we humans say}. Now I \hatr\ \qdesc{cannot sleep} \emdash\ \hatb\ it is all foggy \imi{mental fog} and \haty\ some fireworks can be heard in the distance. Transition \comm{if it really was a switch} was completely seamless.

Some persistent noise can be heard, along with the \t{twinkle twinkle little star}-like melody.

At some point in time today \t{the twinkle twinkle little star-like melody} went from being poorly played on accordeon/clairnet to truly angelic choir. Now it is more like comedy children's show choo-choo-choo-train.

\hatb\ Head is heavy. Mental fog. Will go back to bed now. Too hot. Can I switch on the senpuku \imi{air fan}? Really want a thing called \qdesc{proper sleep} \emdash\ just finally relax, close the eyes, and stop thinking, perceiving, doing, then tomorrow comes. May I get some rest like this please? I'd rather not use lucid dreamimg for work.
