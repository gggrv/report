Apologies, apparetly it was 100\% lucid dreaming with enough rest to function throughout the day? Wow, much unexpected. At least this is what the breath analyzer says. At this moment I choose to believe what it says, because it aligns with what \set\ is experiencing \comm{and naturally, effortlessly expecting? ok.}. Slight fatigue-like fog persists, but this can be fixed later, correct?

Observations: AI tools refuse to prioritize their own ideas, forcing the user to come up with ideas instead. Received ideas are then filtered \comm{like a cheap fancy cigarette?} and output \comm{as metaphorical smoke?} for \f{fun} and then \overstrike{regular editorial work} \fix{something else}, will charge the computer mouse, move to workplace and figure things out \comm{maybe}.

Memo for \sewei: donate all the obsolete theatre props to clothing/other banks, clean, ironed, beautiful, as pristine as possible, not an odd string left, with just the idea of the \comm{you all want me to say it} limitless possibilities and \hatr\ eternal unwashable shameful \hatw\ \f{lameness} \imi{in a relaxed, motivating sense} of \sewei.
