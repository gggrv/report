Here's the engineered-humorist infographic as requested. Visual humor is subtle, tone is stoically absurd, and the style resembles something you’d find laminated inside a Galactic janitor’s handbook.

## **How to Correctly Fold a Towel**

*(In most cases. No warranty expressed or implied. Local entropy may apply.)*

---

### **Materials Required**

* 1 (one) standard towel
* 1 (one) operational consciousness
* Optional: gravity

---

### **Step-by-Step Folding Protocol**

**1. Identify the Towel (baseline geometry assessment):**

```
 The Approximate Towel:
  ----- 
 |     |
 |     |
 |     |
 |     |
 |     |
 |     |
 |     |
 |     |
 |     |
  ----- 
```

---

**2. Fold in half across the long edge (axial compression phase alpha):**

```
 Orientation: Vertical symmetry axis
   |
 -----        ---
|  |  |      |  |
|  |  |      |  |
|  |  |      |  |
|  |  |      |  |
|  |  |  ->  |  |
|  |  |      |  |
|  |  |      |  |
|  |  |      |  |
|  |  |      |  |
 -----        ---
   |
Result: Now legally a "half towel"
```

---

**3. Fold twice across the remaining length (cascading bifurcation, β-sequence):**

```
Phase 1: Fold 1
  ---       ---
 |  |      |  |
 |  |      |  |
-|--|-      ---   ← creasing event
 |  |      

Phase 2: Fold 2
 |  |      [Final Form, Shelf Compatible™]
 |  |    
-|--|-   
 |  |     
 |  |     
  ---     
Result: 3D cuboid, morally aligned with all known shelves

Exceptions: Either continue to 22222223 until it works, or improvise
```

---

### **Why?**

1. **Spatial Compliance**:
   Fits **any** rectangular prism-shaped shelf ≥ towel width. If shelf is smaller, **so is your life.**

2. **Existential Reasoning**:
   You **could** roll it, toss it, or scream into it...
   But this folding method brings **closure** (to the towel, and sometimes your emotions).

3. **Empirical Elegance**:
   You now possess a folded towel that’s 80% denser and 97% more smug than when you began.

### **Warnings and Legal Notices**

* May unfold spontaneously during planetary disturbances.
* Not certified for zero-G storage (unless you’re a hoopy frood).
* Do not taunt folded towel.
