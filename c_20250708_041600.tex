Tonight, despite the prescribed tranquilizer dose, no sleep. It still feels as if both my hands are about to be torn off. Can a living human person have some sleep please? I need to walk the dog today morning. Can't do so without sleep. No need to ever optimize sleep. Please pause the recording until the morning. Twinkle-twinkle little star being poorly played constantly in the background is distracting and is making me sleep-deprived. Thank you in advance. Thrice. No, as many times as needed. Good night, hopefully, finally.
