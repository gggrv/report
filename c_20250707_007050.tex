Is it ok to play \t{blue archive}? I won't judge. It is beautiful. Even perfect. But only if you skip the story \emdash\ characters are as they are because you made them so, not because of the story that only you yourself want to read. Don't make the characters suffer the story for real. Even canon is unperceivable doujin for the character.

MRI scans are ok if they don't explode my head with me knowing about it and feeling it. I'm made of human meat and bones, am I? Not so sure despite \qdesc{reality}.
